            <h3> Our Story</h3>   
            
                <p> We opened our doors in San Francisco's Noe Valley in June of 1999. What began as a love for baking in a small apartment oven have blossomed into our love of serving sweet treats to the people of San Francisco. </p>
                
                <P>To us, a bakery is everything thatâ€™s right with a neighborhood. We love working dough in the early hours of the morning, the satisfyingly straight rows of baguette, and too-adorable-to-eat cupcakes. We love putting smiles on the faces of little ones, prepping for the big meeting with a great breakfast, and giving an excuse to lingering with an old friend. We love every single minute of being your San Francisco neighborhood bakery.</P>
