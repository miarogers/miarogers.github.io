            <h3> A team that feels a whole lot like family</h3>   
            
                <p> We opened our doors in 1995, and that first day we sold out of every baked good by noon. Over the last twenty years, we’ve learned a few things (like how to keep up with demand!), but are honored to still delight some of those very same customers. </p>
                <p> We, Mary and Michael Gassen, are the husband and wife founding team behind Noe Valley Bakery. Michael is our master baker and Mary is our strategic leader. We’re proud to have built a team of bakers and service professionals who delight in taking care of each other and serving our community.</p>
            <h3> We love being a bakery </h3> 
                <P>To us, a bakery is everything that’s right with a neighborhood. We love working dough in the early hours of the morning, the satisfyingly straight rows of baguette, and too-adorable-to-eat cupcakes. We love putting smiles on the faces of little ones, prepping for the big meeting with a great breakfast, and giving an excuse to lingering with an old friend. We love every single minute of being your San Francisco neighborhood bakery.</P>
