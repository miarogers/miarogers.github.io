                                <p>
                                    Sarah shares with us a story of type and invites us to consider our emotional response to the printed word. Each font/typeface has a personality that influences our interpretation of the words we read by evoking our emotions and setting the scene. We all understand this instinctively but it happens on a subconscious level. Sarah shows us that conscious awareness of the emotional life of fonts can be entertaining and ultimately give us more control over the decisions we make.

                                    Broadway is easily America’s most famous thoroughfare. Starting in lower Manhattan at Bowling Green and running the entire length of the island, it strings together some nine to fifteen neighborhoods—depending on who you ask—before bleeding over into the Bronx, serving as a cross-sectional study of the City’s diversity in ethnicity, utility and design. As the Main Street of Manhattan, Broadway exhibits a catalogue of lettering—from neon lights to mom-and-pop shop signs, from theater marquees to building names. Join Hopes and Fears as we tour the typography of Broadway.

                                <p>
                                    One important facet of graphic design is considering how typography sits in physical space. Not necessarily in an architectural sense, although it could apply. I mean that designing messages outside of any digital platform requires an understanding of how the viewer will see it. Billboards, for example, need to be designed considering the distance at which a driver will see them.
